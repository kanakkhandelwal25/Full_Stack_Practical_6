            <b>Bootstrap</b> is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
            <b>Bootstrap</b> is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. <b>It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework</b> for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). All thanks to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.
